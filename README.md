# CodeMash 2025 Workshop: Expo Router
Workshop starter template for the Expo Router workshop at CodeMash 2025.

## How to use this repo

1. Fork this repo. You'll start working right on `main`.
2. Grab the [lessons from here](https://github.com/keith-kurak/expo-router-codemash-2025-lessons) (clone it or open it in your browser, whatever works for you).
2. Start at the first module by opening up the file starting with "01-".
3. Do the rest of the modules in order.

## Prerequisites / How to be ready for the workshop
Make sure these steps are done ahead of time to be ready to start working on the workshop exercises.

### 1. Make sure these are installed on your computer
- [Node LTS version (18+)](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Web browser (any modern browser should do)

This workshop is compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### 2. Install Expo Go on your mobile device
Expo Go is a sandbox for running React Native code on your phone.

- [Install Expo Go on your device from your phone's app store](https://expo.dev/go)

Alternatively, you can use an emulator/simulator and the Expo CLI will install Expo Go can do that automatically when you perform the next steps below.

For most exercises, Expo Go and the web browser are interchangable for testing your code, so don't worry if you have issues with this step.

### 3. Download the starter repo and make sure it works

Do these steps to ensure you'll be ready to go when the workshop starts:

1. Fork and clone the [Starter repo]([lessons from here](https://github.com/keith-kurak/expo-router-codemash-2025-starter) to your computer. (I recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) if you don't already have a git client)

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code and install the recommended extensions when it prompts you do to so.

3. Restore dependencies with

```npm install```

4. Run `npx expo start`

5. Press `w` to open the app in your web browser.

6. Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal with your phone to test the app in Expo Go.

#### Installing on an Android emulator / iOS simulator
If you already have Android Studio and/or Xcode installed, you can run on an emulator/simulator by pressing `a` (for Android) or `i` (for iOS) after running `npx expo start`.

### Day-of-workshop (or night before) tips
- Expo Go works best if your computer and your phone are on the same wifi network, so connect both to the conference wifi.
- Pull changes from the forked starter repo and run `npm install` again right before the workshop, as there will be fixes and version bumps!
